# Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SVM and ANN

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages machine learning algorithmsâ€”Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)â€”to classify network traffic as either 'normal' or 'attack'. The system incorporates feature selection techniques, specifically Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS) and Chi-Square, to enhance model accuracy and reduce dataset dimensionality.

## ðŸ§ª Features

* **Machine Learning Models**: SVM and ANN for classification tasks.
* **Feature Selection**: Utilizes CFS and Chi-Square methods to select relevant features.
* **Dataset**: Compatible with standard IDS datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD).
* **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* pip or conda


## ðŸ“Š Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| SVM   | 92.5%    | 91.0%     | 93.2%  | 92.1%    |
| ANN   | 94.8%    | 93.5%     | 95.0%  | 94.2%    |

*Note: These metrics are based on the NSL-KDD dataset.*

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: Python 3.7.0
* **Libraries**:

  * scikit-learn
  * TensorFlow/Keras
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
* **Feature Selection**: Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-Square
